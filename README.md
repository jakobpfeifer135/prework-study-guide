## Description

 
the purpose of this prework study guide is to assist in the learning process for new students or people that need a slight refresher on the material of JavaScript, CSS, Git, and HTML 5.

My motivation for this is that at times it can be overwhelming to absorb a lot of new information so people can use this as something to look back on in case they have any questions.
